collective.sentry
=================

Sentry integration with Zope.

Requirements
------------

* Plone 5.2, 5.1 (tested)
* Python 3.6+, 2.7 (tested)

Installation
------------

Add `collective.sentry` to your buildout and re-run buildout.

Configuration
-------------

Configure the Sentry DSN by setting the environment variable `SENTRY_DSN` inside your shell configuration or using buildout::

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        SENTRY_DSN https://......

Supplementary information logged in Sentry
------------------------------------------

`collective.sentry` will create automatically a Sentry tag `instance_name`
which is derived from the buildout part name of the related instance.  An
additional tag `project` can be configured (optional) if you set the
environment variable `SENTRY_PROJECT`.  This allows you introduce an additional
tag for filtering, if needed.


Set `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` to differentiate between environments e.g. staging vs production
(https://docs.sentry.io/enriching-error-data/environments/)

Set `SENTRY_RELEASE` to sent release information to sentry. (https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/)

Set `SENTRY_INTEGRATIONS` (comma separated) for different Integrations. (https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/)

Optional activation
---------------------
By default, if you install `collective.sentry` along you eggs, the instance start will crash if you do not configure `SENTRY_DSN`.
But sometime, you have multiple environments where you want that the product to be loaded, without doing anything under the hood (same conf for dev & prod, but no sentry on dev).
To enable this behavior, add `SENTRY_OPTIONAL=1` to your environment variables.
